The FT’s time-weighted average of [seven pollsters’ latest polls](http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/index.htm) of voting intention suggests that Ms Merkels’s Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, should comfortably remain the largest party.

But under Germany’s proportional representation system, this is unlikely to translate into a majority of seats in the new parliament, so how the other parties perform will determine the coalition that forms the next German government.

## The voting system

In Germany’s “[mixed-member proportional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation)” system, voters make two marks on their ballots: one for a consituency MP and one for a party list.

About half the Bundestag are constituency MPs elected by first-past-the-post. The remainder come from the party lists, allocated to closely approximate the distribution of the party vote after taking into account the directly-elected MPs. This results in a seat distribution that is relatively close to the national popular vote.

One complication is that a party must win five per cent of the national vote — or win three constituency pluralities  — for its party list votes to be included in the seat allocation process.

## The parties

* [Angela Merkel](https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Angela_Merkel)’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union)

* The centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) enjoyed a surge in support after selecting [Martin Schulz](https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Martin_Schulz) as their [new leader](https://www.ft.com/content/3a426f44-e246-11e6-8405-9e5580d6e5fb?mhq5j=e1), but have since fallen back in the polls.

* The Left (Linke) party traces its origins to East Germany’s communists and leftwingers who split from the SPD. Its figurehead [Sahra Wagenknecht](https://www.ft.com/content/6dee5340-f9ab-11e6-9516-2d969e0d3b65) remains a polarising figure, but there is one scenario where she and her co-chairman Dietmar Bartsh could find themselves in government.

* The [Green](https://www.ft.com/stream/66be4f3c-4c22-3bea-91cb-85cc3f504d0b) (Grüne) party’s [support has been flagging](https://www.ft.com/content/7a82714a-15f3-11e7-b0c1-37e417ee6c76) but co-chairs Katrin Göring-Eckardt and [Cem Özdemir](https://www.ft.com/stream/6eb17739-b939-38ee-8558-93ae3892b99a) could be kingmakers in coalitions with either major party.

* The liberal [Free Democratic party](https://www.ft.com/stream/5155b480-7d86-3d92-b364-9591051447ea) (FDP) was booted out of the Bundestag after failing to reach the 5 per cent threashold in 2013, but is expected to return, led by 38-year-old [Christian Lindner](https://www.ft.com/content/c23bc27a-3c72-11e7-ac89-b01cc67cfeec).

* The rightwing populist [Alternative for Germany](https://www.ft.com/stream/77210aa2-bfe4-3190-b76f-1603ab1a8b16) (AfD) looks likely to win seats at the federal level for the first time. It has sought to soften its image by selecting [Alice Weidel](https://www.ft.com/content/800bc828-357e-11e7-99bd-13beb0903fa3), who is gay, atop its ticket alongside Alexander Gauland, who represents its nationalist-conservative wing.

## Possible coalitions

German coalitions are often described in terms of the party colours of the parties of which they are comprised. Five possible outcomes seem likely in this election:

* **Grand Coalition**: Alliances of the centre-right CDU and centre-left SPD, like the current government, have become a fixture in German politics as fragmentation has made it difficult for either major party to govern with just one of the smaller parties.

* **Red-Red-Green**: An leftwing government led by Martin Schulz of the SPD and backed by the Left and Greens, seems like the only scenario that could end Angela Merkel’s continued Chancellorship.

* **Black-Yellow**: The CDU would probably prefer a partnership with a smaller party, and the free-market FDP would likely be its preferred ally.

* **Black-Green**: A coalition between the CDU and the Green party currenty governs two of Germany's states, but has never run the Federal government.

* **Jamaica**: A three-way coalition with the colours of the Jamaican flag — CDU, FDP and Greens — has formed state governments including one formed in June following elections in Schleswig-Holstein. But it would be a novelty at the federal level.

## Methodology

At each point in time, the FT poll-of-polls includes the most recent voting-intention poll from seven pollsters, compiled by Wahlrecht.de. The average of their results is weighted to give more recent polls greater influence on the net score. The code performing these calcuations can be found on the FT Visual Journalism team’s Github page.
